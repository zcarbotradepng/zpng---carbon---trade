Project Proposal # ZPNG Carbon Trade Facilitator – Project Proposal

## 1. Introduction

The **ZPNG Carbon Trade Facilitator** is a Papua New Guinea-based initiative dedicated to linking native landowners with global carbon trading markets. Founded by Leuka Roger Kehenae, this initiative promotes environmental sustainability, rural development, and community empowerment through forest conservation and carbon offset programs.

## 2. Project Background

Papua New Guinea possesses rich biodiversity and large tracts of forested customary land. However, many rural communities lack the means and knowledge to access international carbon markets. This initiative bridges that gap by:

- Educating local landowners about carbon trading.
- Facilitating project registration and certification.
- Hosting and managing carbon offset projects.
- Expanding seedling nurseries and reforestation efforts.

## 3. Target Area

- **Primary Project Site**: Zarinka, Dunatina LLG, Henganofi District, Eastern Highlands Province
- **Expansion Area**: Entire Henganofi District, subject to successful engagement

## 4. Core Component – Korente Native Plant Nursery

Established 15 years ago, the **Korente Native Plant Nursery** is a key asset in this initiative. It supplies native tree seedlings to local communities at affordable prices and is ready to scale up with proper support to meet district-wide reforestation goals.

## 5. Objectives

- Connect with global carbon trading organizations.
- Secure investment or partnership for community-based carbon offset projects.
- Expand Korente Native Plant Nursery to district level.
- Build awareness and technical capacity among landowners.
- Establish long-term monitoring and reporting systems.

## 6. Community Impact

- Sustainable income for landowners through carbon credit sales
- Reforestation and biodiversity conservation
- Improved climate change awareness and environmental responsibility
- Youth engagement and local employment

## 7. What We Need

We are seeking:
- Technical guidance in project certification (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard)
- Support for awareness and education programs
- Funding or partnerships to expand the nursery
- GIS and satellite monitoring tools or training
